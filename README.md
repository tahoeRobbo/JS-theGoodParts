"The plan is - after doing this, you are going to be about 100X  smarter about functions"



#All higher-order functions, some cool ish covered included:

--basic binary add/mul functions

--take in a binary function and make it callable from two invocations

--currying

--converting binary functions to methods

--converting methods to binary functions

--Calling multiple binary or unary functions 

--passing return of one function as argument of another

--Making a function able to only be called once

--returning multiple methods on an object via constructors

--make a function temporary and it's ability to be called revokable
